    <p id="third">Dugongs are a keystone and critically endangered species, and there are very few left in our oceans, so there was a need to create a device for the conservation of dugongs<br>which was demanded by the Wildlife Institute of India. We created an IOT device which helped in creating India's first dugoong sanctuary in Tamil Nadu.<br> GPS stands for global positioning system it takes help of the satellites and it logs the position of device at regular intervals in its memory thus creating a trace where<br> the boat has travelled and the devices are given to the fishermen who carry them around in the waters, they are also given a data sheet where they can note the time<br> stamp of sighting of a dugong and now with these we have the location of dugong and the data is gathered where is the location of the species so they can be protected. <br>This project's components include the Node MCU ESP 8266, which connects the objects and allows data transfer via the Wi-Fi protocol, and the EM-406 GPS Receiver. <br>determines the location of satellites and a Neo-6M GPS chip. It can track up to 22 satellites and 50 channels and achieve the industry's highest level of sensitivity.</p>
