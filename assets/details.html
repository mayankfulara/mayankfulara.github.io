    <p id="third">Dugongs are a keystone and critically endamgerd species and are very few left in our oceans so there was a need to create a device for the conservation of dugongs<br> sanctury which was demanded by the wildlife institute of india. We created an IOT device which helped in creating indias first dugoong sanctuary in Tamil Nadu.<br> GPS stands for global positioning system it takes help of the satellites and it logs the position of device at regular intervals in its memory thus creating a trace where<br> the boat has travelled and the devices are given to the fishermen who carry them around in the waters, they are also given a data sheet where they can note the time<br> stamp of sighting of a dugong and now with these we have the location of dugong and the data is gathered where is the location of the species so they can be protected. <br>The components used in this project are Node MCU ESP 8266 it connects the objects and lets data transfer using the Wi-Fi protocol EM-406 Gps Receiver which <br>determines the location of satellites and a Neo-6M GPS chip it can track up to 22 satellites and 50 channels and achieves industries highest level of sensitivity.</p>
